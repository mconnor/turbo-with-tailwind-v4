I'm a graphic designer who believes design is more than just pretty picturesâ€”it's visual storytelling with purpose.

## My Journey

My love for design started in my college dorm room, where I'd spend hours tinkering with typography and color palettes. What began as a hobby quickly became a passion, and now it's my career. I've been fortunate to work with clients ranging from scrappy startups to established brands, each project teaching me something new.

## What I Do

My design philosophy is simple: great design solves problems while delighting the eye. I specialize in:

- Brand identity design
- Digital illustrations
- User interface design
- Visual storytelling

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not designing, you'll find me:

- Hunting for vintage design books
- Experimenting with watercolor painting
- Exploring local coffee shops with my sketchbook
- Listening to design podcasts (total design nerd alert!)

## Let's Connect

Want to chat design, collaborate, or just share a good coffee recommendation? Drop me a line. I'm always excited to meet fellow creatives and explore new design adventures.
